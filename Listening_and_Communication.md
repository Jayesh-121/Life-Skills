# Listening and Active Communication
## 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

- Try not to interupt the speaker and let them finish before responding.
- Use verbal cues to let the speaker know you're listening.
- Use visual gestures to let the speaker know you're invested in the topic and conversation.
- Paraphrase what the speaker is saying to make sure you're both on the same page.
- If appropriate, take notes if the conversation may be important.

## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
