# Tiny Habits

## Tiny Habits

### **Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
The most interesting idea was how BJ Fogg used very tiny habits, like doing just two push-ups, to slowly build real fitness. It shows that tiny actions, if done consistently, can result in big long-term change.

### **Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P?**
B = MAP states that a Behavior (B) happens with:

- Motivation (M) – how much you *want* to do the habit  
- Ability (A) – how *easy* the habit is  
- Prompt (P) – what *reminds* you to do it  

To make a habit easier, increase Ability by making the habit tiny, and pair it with a clear Prompt.

### **Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful habit?**
Celebration creates a positive emotional moment that tells your brain:  
“This behavior feels good — remember it.”

BJ Fogg calls this feeling "Shine", and it helps habits stick faster.  
Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.

## 1% Better Every Day 

### **Question 4: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

## Atomic Habits 

### **Question 5: What is the book’s perspective about Identity?**
The book teaches that real habit change comes from changing your identity, not just your goals.  
Instead of trying to do actions, you focus on becoming the kind of person who naturally does them.  
Habits are small votes for the identity you want.

### **Question 6: What is the book’s perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**
- Make it **obvious** → keep cues visible  
- Make it **attractive** → pair it with something enjoyable  
- Make it **easy** → reduce friction; make the habit tiny  
- Make it **satisfying** → add a reward or track progress  

The principle: **make the habit so easy that you can’t refuse.**

---

### **Question 7: What is the book’s perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**
- Make it **invisible** → remove cues  
- Make it **unattractive** → associate it with negative outcomes  
- Make it **difficult** → add friction or obstacles  
- Make it **unsatisfying** → remove rewards; add accountability  

When a bad habit becomes inconvenient and unrewarding, it fades away.
