# Good Practices for Software Development

### Question 1  
**Which point(s) were new to you?**

Some points that felt new and particularly insightful were:
- The emphasis on over-communicating even for issues like power, internet, or hardware problems, as it helps manage expectations proactively.
- The idea that how a question is framed directly affects the quality and speed of responses, especially the importance of explaining what has already been tried.
- The suggestion to use tools like GitHub gists, CodeSandbox, or Loom to make questions clearer and easier to answer.
- Treating preserving attention as a skill that can be consciously improved over time, rather than something fixed.

### Question 2  
**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

One key area to improve is asking better questions when stuck. To make progress in this area:
- I can clearly describe the problem, expected behavior, and actual behavior before reaching out.
- I can list the steps or solutions I have already tried to avoid repetitive suggestions.
- I can use screenshots, short screencasts, or minimal reproducible examples to provide better context.
- I can refer to how issues are reported in open-source projects and try to follow a similar structured approach.

Improving this will help me get quicker, more accurate help and also build better communication with the team.
