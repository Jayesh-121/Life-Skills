# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any **unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature** that creates discomfort, intimidation, or a hostile work environment. Such behaviour may be verbal, non-verbal, physical, or written. Examples include:

- **Verbal behaviour**: sexually suggestive comments or jokes, remarks about appearance, intrusive personal questions, or repeated unwanted advances.
- **Non-verbal behaviour**: staring, leering, inappropriate gestures, or displaying sexually explicit images or content.
- **Physical behaviour**: unwanted touching, deliberate brushing against someone, blocking movement, or any physical contact without consent.
- **Digital or written behaviour**: inappropriate messages, emails, images, or social media interactions of a sexual nature.
- **Power-based harassment**: demands or expectations of sexual favours in exchange for professional benefits or to avoid negative consequences.
- **Hostile work environment**: repeated actions that create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment, even if not directed at a specific individual.

The **impact on the person receiving the behaviour**, not the intent, determines whether it is considered sexual harassment.

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness such behaviour?

If I face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, I would take the following steps:

- **Clearly express discomfort** and ask the behaviour to stop, if it is safe to do so.
- **Document the incident(s)**, including dates, times, locations, individuals involved, and any witnesses.
- **Report the matter** to the Internal Committee (IC) or the designated PoSH authority as per organizational policy.
- **Support the affected individual** if I am a witness, encourage reporting, and offer assistance or testimony if required.
- **Maintain confidentiality** and avoid retaliation or informal confrontation.
- **Follow organizational procedures** to ensure the issue is handled fairly, sensitively, and professionally.
